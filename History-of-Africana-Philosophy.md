[historyofphilosophy.net/africana-philosophy](https://historyofphilosophy.net/africana-philosophy) - [rss](https://hopwag2.podbean.com/feed.xml)

> This series of episodes, co-written by Chike Jeffers of Dalhousie University, examines philosophy originating from Africa and the African diaspora. Beginning with the origins of humanity in Africa and philosophical literature in ancient Egypt, the story will go up to the twentieth century and beyond. Major themes include African oral traditions, reactions to the depredations of colonialism and enslavement, political philosophy and philosophy of race developed in the twentieth century, and the emergence of Africana thought within academia.
