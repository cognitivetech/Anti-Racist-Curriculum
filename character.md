# Qualities of Character

**Premise**: We often make snap judgements about people based on the way they look: sex, race, culture, fitness, dress, physical features. Research in implicit bias suggests that we all have various biases that tend to remain unconscious unless we go out of our way to examine that.

Instead of being stuck with those biases, we can create a different type of story about people we don't know. Instead of basing this on their appearance and our cultural conditioning, we could imagine what are their character traits. Ultimately, that's how everyone wants to be considered, by the qualities of their character. 

We can make fun stories about the people who cross our paths based on these positive character traits, and train our brains to judge people in this manner, appreciating them for the qualities of their character rather than superficial impressions.

If you have already a positive story in your mind about someone you don't know, then you both are likely to have a better experience, regardless of whether you meet or not.
