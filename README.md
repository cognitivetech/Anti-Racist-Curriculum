#  Challenging Racism from Within - Antiracist curriculum.

For my own self-education and hopefully helpful for others challenging their own biases and ignorance around race.

## Types of Racism
* [The Four Types of Racism](https://unitedwaynca.org/blog/levels-of-racism/)- United Way of the National Capital Area
  - Internalized or Personal Racism
  - Interpersonal Racism
  - Institutional Racism
  - Structural Racism
* [Bias: Implicit and Explicit](https://www.atrainceu.com/content/1-bias-implicit-and-explicit) ATrain Education
  - Implicit bias is an attitude or internalized stereotype that affects an individual’s perception, action, or decision-making in an unconscious manner.
  - Explicit or conscious bias occurs when we are aware of our prejudices and attitudes toward certain groups.

### Implicit Bias

  > Scientists are beginning to recognize that the amygdala, rather than responding exclusively to negative or fear-inducing stimuli, instead seems to be exquisitely sensitive to emotionally important information in the environment. This is a subtle but important difference, and suggests that depending on the task or the situation at hand, the amygdala may be able to respond differentially.

## Critical Race Theory

* [Critical Race Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_race_theory) Wikipedia
  > CRT began in the United States in the post–civil rights era, as 1960s landmark civil rights laws were being eroded and schools were being re-segregated. With racial inequalities persisting even after civil rights legislation and color-blind laws were enacted, CRT scholars in the 1970s and 1980s began reworking and expanding critical legal studies (CLS) theories on class, economic structure, and the law to examine the role of U.S. law in perpetuating racism.
* [What Is Critical Race Theory, and Why Is It Under Attack?](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05) Stephen Sawchuk, EDWeek
  > Fundamentally, though, the disagreement springs from different conceptions of racism. CRT puts an emphasis on outcomes, not merely on individuals’ own beliefs, and it calls on these outcomes to be examined and rectified. Among lawyers, teachers, policymakers, and the general public, there are many disagreements about how precisely to do those things, and to what extent race should be explicitly appealed to or referred to in the process.

* [A Lesson on Critical Race Theory](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/civil-rights-reimagining-policing/a-lesson-on-critical-race-theory/) Janel George, American Bar Association
  > CRT is not a diversity and inclusion “training” but a practice of interrogating the role of race and racism in society that emerged in the legal academy and spread to other fields of scholarship. Crenshaw—who coined the term “CRT”—notes that CRT is not a noun, but a verb. It cannot be confined to a static and narrow definition but is considered to be an evolving and malleable practice. It critiques how the social construction of race and institutionalized racism perpetuate a racial caste system that relegates people of color to the bottom tiers. CRT also recognizes that race intersects with other identities, including sexuality, gender identity, and others.
* [Book] [Critical Race Theory: An Introduction, Second Edition](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qg9h2) Richard Delgado, Jean Stefancic
  > The critical race theory (CRT) movement is a collection of activists and scholars interested in studying and transforming the relationship among race, racism, and power. The movement considers many of the same issues that conventional civil rights and ethnic studies discourses take up, but places them in a broader perspective that includes economics, history, context, group- and self-interest, and even feelings and the unconscious. Unlike traditional civil rights, which stresses incrementalism and step-by-step progress, critical race theory questions the very foundations of the liberal order, including equality theory, legal reasoning, Enlightenment rationalism, and neutral principles of constitutional law.

  > The August 9th 2014 police killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown sparked a smoldering nationwide movement against police violence and, more broadly, against anti-Black racism. As Mike Brown, Eric Garner, and Tamir Rice have become household names and faces, their stories have become an impetus for public policy debates on the future of policing in America.
  >
  > However, 2014 also marked the unjust police killings of a number of Black women, 1 including Gabriella Nevarez, Aura Rosser, Michelle Cusseaux, and Tanisha Anderson. The body count of Black women killed by the police continued to rise in 2015 with the killings of Alexia Christian, Meagan Hockaday, Mya Hall, Janisha Fonville, and Natasha McKenna.
  > 
  > The lack of meaningful accountability for the deaths of unarmed Black men also extended to deaths of unarmed Black women and girls in 2015. Just as the officers who killed Mike Brown and Eric Garner escaped punishment for these homicides, officers who killed Black women and girls were not held accountable for their actions. Joseph Weekley, who killed a sleeping, seven-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones, escaped prosecution after a jury failed to convict him in his second trial. Dante Servin, an off-duty officer who shot Rekia Boyd in the back of the head, was cleared by a judge of all charges. Other officers faced no charges whatsoever, such as those who killed Mya Hall, a Black transgender woman.

### Literature
* [Violent State: Black Women's Invisible StruggleAgainst Police Violence](https://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1828&context=facultypub) - Fall 2017 Michelle S. Jacobs
  > University of Florida Levin College of Law The theme of this special issue, Women and Law Enforcement, is particularly timely. Incidents of police brutality have reached a new level of public visibility. Though not everyone agrees on whether the use of violence by the police is inappropriate, conversations about police violence are occurring everywhere. An exploration of the topic of Women and Law Enforcement would not be complete without at least one article that puts Black women at the center of the lens of analysis, particularly as it relates to the state-sponsored violence Black women experience at the hands of law enforcement. This Article is about law enforcement’s violence towards Black women specifically. The reader should not feel free to substitute the phrase “women of color” where “Black women” has been written. The Article is not about “women of color.” For decades now, mainstream feminists have attempted to discuss violence against women, while relegating the experiences of Asian women, Native American women, Latinas, and Black women into one category called “women of color.” Scholarship describes the experiences of White women as normative, all other women experiences are subsumed in those. For over twenty years now, the data (when you can find data specifically about non-White women) consistently shows that the communities of non-White women do experience violence, both at the hands of the state, as well as at the hands of intimates, but that violence manifests differently in each community.1
* [Race and Reasonableness in Police Killings](https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3660&context=faculty_scholarship)
  > Police officers in the United States have killed over 1000 civilians each year since 2013. The constitutional landscape that regulates these encounters defaults to the judgments of the reasonable police officer at the time of a civilian encounter based on the officer’s assessment of whether threats to their safety or the safety of others requires deadly force. As many of these killings have begun to occur under similar circumstances, scholars have renewed a contentious debate on whether police disproportionately use deadly force against African Americans and other nonwhite civilians and whether such killings reflect racial bias. We analyze data on 3933 killings to examine this intersection of race and reasonableness in police killings. First, we describe the objective circumstances and interactions of police killings and map those event characteristics to the elements of reasonableness articulated in case law. Second, we assess whether inherently vague constitutional regulation of lethal force is applied differently by officers depending on the civilian’s race, giving rise to a disproportionate rate of deaths among racial and ethnic minority groups. We then assess the prospects for remediation of racialized police killings by testing the effects of an existing evidence-based training curricula designed to reduce police use of deadly force towards persons experiencing mental illness
